        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/picture 1.jpg" />
        <p>Once upon a time, in a land far away, I was born. On this great day of February the 5th 1990, the world was
            blessed with a big headed, fat little baby.

            I was born in Pomona California. A decent enough place to raise a kid. The first couple of years are a blur,
            I'm not gonna lie about that. I must have

            been drunk off of some milky substance. My first memory is very vivid. I was sitting at my dinning room
            table chocking on cereal! I know pretty dark, but

            thats the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about my first memory. After this the memories just
            start flowing. From the first time I played
            on the Super Nintendo, to playing Pogs. Life was starting and it was great.

        </p>
        <p>Lets fast foward a couple of years and boom, I'm a teenager. By this time I was playing baseball,
            skateboarding, and hardcore into video games. I played

            baseball for 5 years right into highschool. It was a lot of fun, but i knew my career was coming to an end.
            The main reason for that was.... Girls! I

            also was skateboarding around the same time. Falling and scrapping my knees with each flip, but again my
            carrer came to a screeching hault. Why... Girls!

            As you can tell by now, girls became a big distraction. Who knows what I would have become if it wasn't for
            them. I could have been in the MLB or a Pro
            Skater. It's ok though, everything happens for a reason.

        </p>
        <p>Then we come to the last thing that has Conquered most of my time and girls. You guess it, its Video Games!
            Well they share the time with girls, equally.

            Since the first time I picked up a controller at 4 years old, I was hooked. I played it all. From Super
            Nintendo, N64, Gamecube, PC, Playstation 1,2,3, and 4.

            Now my goal is to become a professional gamer! Just in case I suck, I will learn how to code as my backup
            career.
